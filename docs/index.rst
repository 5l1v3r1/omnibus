OSINT Omnibus
===================================

Omnibus is an easy to user interactive command line applications for users to perform OSINT investigation of artifacts such as IP addresses, domains, email addresses, user names, file hashes, and Bitcoin addresses.

An Omnibus is defined as a volume containing several novels or other items previously published separately and that is exactly what the InQuest Omnibus project intends to be for Open Source Intelligence collection, research, and artifact management.

The project requires both MongoDB and Redis running in order to store artifact data long term and while within a CLI session, respectively.
